# 02 Portfolio

## Description

This is a work in progress portfolio. The objective is to have a working HTML and CSS to meet certain criteria. The criteria were:

- To a website of my previous work
- The Navigation will scroll to the corresponding section
- The first section with with titled images will link to my first application.
- Make a dynamic display that will adjust to the screen size. 

I was able to meet most of the criteria, I didn't get the dynamic display to work. I wasn't able to figure out how to use flex-box.
